      <h3>Systems & Complexity</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>1. What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</dt>
        <dd> A. A system is a group of dynamic and interacting parts that work together to create a unified whole. </dd>
        <dt>2. For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</dt>
        <dd> A. Modularity can be described as parts of a system that can be interchangeable and still serve their purpose as a part of the whole. </dd>
        <dd> B. Decomposability is breaking down an element so much that it is no longer functional and serves no purpose. An example of this is your body breaking down food to get the nutrients. </dd>
        <dd> C. Emergence is when certain characteristics arise out of a system when its parts are working together that are otherwise no longer there when the parts are separate. </dd>
        <dd> D. Chaos Theory is about unpredictable behaviour that arises from systems with defined rules. </dd>

        <dt>3. Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.</dt>
        <dd> A. A tessellation is made up of geometrical shapes that have been closely fit together without gaps or overlaps of the shapes creating patterns. One example of tessellations are brick walls. The rectangles are placed edge to edge and they don't overlap or have gaps.</dd>

      <dt>4. What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other?</dt>
      <dd> A. With modularity you can move parts of the system around and the system will still work, but with tessellations the element only fits exactly where you place them, anything else will mess it up.</dd>

    <dt>5. What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</dt>
    <dd> A. If something is uniform it creates a pattern that can be consistently repeated and rotated in any way. An aperiodic pattern cannot be repeated nor can it be rotated to create the same pattern..</dd>

  <h3>Material Speculation</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinosaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</dt>
    <dd> A. Originally we thought dinosaurs were slow, short and big. They thought the reason they were extinct is because they were dumb and slow. After studying the anatomy of the fossil, they realized dinosaurs were actually super athletic and agile. </dd>
    <dt>2. The artist/archaeologist John Conway who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that remind you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.
</dt>
    <dd> A. This can apply to any sort of speculative field. </dd>
    <dt>3. First, summarize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Then given this article's examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past?</dt>
    <dd> A. Material speculation are speculative designs/things that do not exist in this world but could potentially exist in different worlds. However when speculative artifacts are created they are meant to be perceived as of this world. Speculative artifacts are designed with the intent to explore possibilities. An example in the article is the Obscura 1C and Mediated body, they take familiar things and morph them to unfamiliar purposes. This same technique can be compared to John Conway who speculates on what dinosaurs from the past looked like.
</dd>

  <dt>4. What are the 4 most common kinds of artifacts listed in the readings? As these are broad categories can you list, some more specific ones? They may be either a part of these categories as a subtopic or maybe not under these classifications at all. List 4 more categories and give examples.</dt>
  <dd> A. Historical and cultural, media, knowledge, and data are the 4 most common types of artifacts. Some categories from historical and cultural artifacts could be jewelry, weapons, artwork, and pottery.</dd>
