      <p>Artist Statement: For this project I wanted to created curvy shapes because I thought they would look cool in the paper cut tessalation. That proved to be a bad decision because I am bad with scissors and cuting tight curves exactly the same
        was very difficult. It was hard to keep the shapes consistent but luckily pieices still fit together. I think the one aspect I worried about in this projects was everyong getting their shared side done correctly. </p>

      <p>Artist Statement: Since I was using the paper I knew getting the pieces to fit snuggly and locked in place would be difficult. I chose to do a slot fastner with a "locking mechanism". Basically the piece that goes into the slot has a wide
        connector, you have to slip the paper in at an agnle and when you pull on it it wont come out because the slit is not as long as the connector piece. I didn't really like the paper because it was too flimsy. </p>

          <p>Artist Statement: Scientists have estimated that there are around 8.7 million species of plants and animals in existence. However, only around 1.2 million species have been identified. In Xeno Forest, we wanted to speculate what type of
            plants exsist that have not been discovered yet. We give the user the role of a botantist so they can make their own creations of what may be out their. For this project, I knew we needed to create a base and from there the other group members and myself would create wierd plant pieces. I feel like we did a good job with the designing and laser cutting, the pieces all fit snuggly together. We did have an issue after painting the slots were too tight but that was resolved by an afternoon of sanding. My contributions: designed the base and bush pieces, painted and sanded my pieces, designed the schema.</p>
